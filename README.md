# Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition using Background Elimination and CNNs
A simple application of Convolutional Neural Networks combined with background elimination to detect different hand gestures specifically alphabets from sign language. A background elimination algorithm extracts the hand image from webcam and uses it to predict the type of gesture/alphabet that is.
